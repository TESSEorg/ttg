# TTG Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The TTG community is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be kind and courteous.** There's no need to be mean or rude.
- **Respect differences of opinion.** Every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer.
- **Keep criticism constructive.** When you disagree with something, explain what you would do differently and why.
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports all participants.
- **Be patient.** Remember that people have varying levels of experience and knowledge. Make space for newcomers.
- **Assume good faith.** When in doubt, assume that people mean well and are doing their best.
- **Focus on the work.** We're here to build and improve TTG together.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable in our community:

- **Harassment.** This includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention.
- **Discrimination.** Treating people differently based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.
- **Threats or violent language** directed against another person.
- **Posting sexually explicit or violent material.**
- **Personal insults.** Especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
- **Unwelcome sexual attention.** This includes sexualized comments, jokes, or imagery in any forum.
- **Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.**
- **Repeated harassment.** If someone asks you to stop, stop.

On GitHub, Zulip, email lists, and other online forums, please also avoid:

- **Trolling, flaming, or attention-seeking behavior** that disrupts constructive discussion
- **Spam or off-topic content**
- **Posting others' private information** (doxxing), such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all TTG community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories under the TESSEorg organization
- Issue trackers and pull requests
- Community forums and discussion platforms
- TTG events, workshops, and conferences
- Email communication regarding TTG
- Any other forums created by the project team for community communication

It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at:

**ttg-conduct@vt.edu**

You may also contact the project leadership directly:
- Eduard Valeyev (Virginia Tech)
- Robert J. Harrison (Stony Brook University)
- Joseph Schuchart (Stony Brook University)

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames, real names) of any individuals involved
- Description of the behavior and the circumstances
- Any additional context or evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Whether you would like to remain anonymous to the accused

### Enforcement Actions

Project maintainers who receive reports of Code of Conduct violations will:

1. **First offense:** Issue a warning to the violator, explaining what was inappropriate and why.

2. **Second offense:** Temporary restriction from community spaces (e.g., temporary ban from GitHub, mailing lists, or chat). Duration depends on severity.

3. **Continued violations:** Permanent ban from all TTG community spaces.

For severe violations (threats, harassment of a protected group, doxxing), maintainers may skip directly to a temporary or permanent ban.

Maintainers may, at their discretion, lift a ban if the violator makes a genuine apology and demonstrates understanding of why their behavior was inappropriate.

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, please report it using the same process.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

Maintainers themselves are held to a higher standard than other community members and will be held accountable for their actions.
